This is a fullstack app working with node js connecting to mongodb at the backend and a react app on the front End

## Getting Started

First, install the node modules files by using the npm i command on the both backend(Project folder) and frontend(businessmanager folder):
In order for the connection to the mongodb to work, create a db with the name CustomersAndCardsProject, you can create just a "Test" collection




Then, start the app
```bash
npm run dev
```
And the backend
```bash
node app
```
